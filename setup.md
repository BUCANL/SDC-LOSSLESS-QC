title: Setup
---
- We will be using `*_ll.set` and `*_ll.fdt` files from the output of the pipeline. For the tutorial, use the face13 dataset.
- If the lossless pipeline tutorial has been completed, use the `*_ll.*` files from the output.
- If the lossless pipeline tutorial has not been completed, the `*_ll.*` files can be retrieved from Globus (see setup of SDC-LOSSLESS tuturial)
