1. Open MATLAB (pre-2014b works fastest) and change your **Current Folder** by navigating to the Lossless pipeline root directory (in this case, face_13).

2. Open EEGLAB by typing the following into the console window:

    `>> addpath code`  
    `>> lossless_path`  
    `>> eeglab`  

3. Next, set the default figure renderer to be OpenGL. This is usually only necessary in older versions of MATLAB (pre-2014b):

    `>> set(0,'DefaultFigureRenderer','OpenGL');`

4. In the main EEGLAB window, navigate to **File->Vised Configuration**. 

5. Add the vised configuration file by clicking **Load vised config** and then navigate to the config folder (`derivatives/lossless/code/config/`). Select the file named `vised_config_qc.cfg`, and click **OK**. The vised configuration file will load certain settings that are preferable for the QC procedure.

    **Add an image of the eeglab window and of the Vised Config (FIXME).** 

6. In the main eeglab window, navigate to **File->Batch->Run History Template Batch**.

7. In the **Run History Template Batch** window, add a Context configuration file. The default file will be sufficient for this task: `derivatives/loseless/code/config/contextconfig.cfg`. 

8. Click **History File** and add the `qc.htb` script located in `derivatives/loseless/code/scripts/`.

9. Open up a terminal window, and navigate to your local project directory:

    `>> cd path/to/project/directory/face_13/`

10. List all the data files youâ€™d like to run through the pipeline. This can be done using the find command. If using the BIDS directory structure, simply type:

    `>> find derivatives/lossless/sub-* -type f -name "*_qc.set"`

11. This will print a list of all your QC-initialized `*_qc.set` files, including the path, which you can then copy straight from the terminal into the **file** field in the **Run History Template Batch** window, with one path/filename per line.

12. Click **Ok** to start the QC batch process.

    **Add an image of the Run History Template Batch menu (FIXME).**

13. Once you click **Ok**, the QC windows will open for your first file. The files will open in alphabetical order. Several windows will open for each file you QC, including: 

    - A window that displays the channel EEG data.

    - A figure that displays an array of squares corresponding to each 1-second epoch of each component. Each square is colored based on its activation difference from the mean.

    - A figure that displays the IC Label classification breakdown for each component

    - A window that shows the component EEG data. This is the window that you will be interacting with as you QC.

    - Window(s) with a topography for each component. The number label for each topography can be clicked to gain more information, such as the component's spectrum, dipole location, and a mini scroll plot of the full waveform for the selected component.

    **Add an image of all the windows (FIXME).** 

    - When you finish the QC procedure, click **Update EEG Structure** and it will save as a `*_qcr.set` and a `*_qcr.fdt` file.
